# About

This zine was created by a collective of diasporic peoples living on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territories of the Lək̓ʷəŋən and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples. The purpose of this zine was to create an interactive and reflection based decolonial resource for self-identifying Black, Indigenous, mixed, and people of colour (BIMPOC). 

Our zine  uses community collaboration, art, and reflection pieces that aim to build and deepen our solidarities towards Indigenous liberation.
