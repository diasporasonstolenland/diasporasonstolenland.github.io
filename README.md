# Diasporas On Stolen Land

The website for the Diasporas On Stolen Land Zine.

The main interesting files are the `.md` files in this folder, feel free to edit them as
you choose, that's where all the content goes. `md` is a Markdown file, you can see what
you can do with that [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), but
I put the most relevant stuff in the `about.md` already as example.

You can add more pages by adding more files by copying one of the other pages
and changing the contents/title/etc. Add links to the navigation by adding to
the list in `_data/navigation.yml`.

You can also edit the title/description (subtitle) in `_config.yml`, just leave the other parts alone.

You can put new images, PDFs, whatever in the `assets` folder, then you can put a link to it like 
`[Download the Zine](/assets/zine.pdf)` in one of the `.md` files and it should work.

Whenever you change a file it will update on the website after a minute or so. If any other questions 
let me know...
